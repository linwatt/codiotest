According to article Teamwork v. Collaboration, "Teamwork and collaboration are cousins, but they're not twins."

A scrum team is a great example of team work.  A group of people with the needed skill sets to complete the sprint goal.  Each member has individual tasks that contributing to reaching the goal.  A developer writing code, quality assurance validating acceptance criteria and a business analyst writing stories.

A collaboration example would be the  Riis leadership team working on the  contract project.  Individually they cannot take a piece to complete on their own to finish the project.  They needed to have team sessions where they make decisions and complete the tasks together.

Team work is just not about doing your piece to reach a goal. As a Riis consultant, we want to help set an example of good team work. A couple of ways we can do that: 

- Keeping a positive attitude and help the team focus on solutions in a bad situations.
 
- Share knowledge or a past experience when a team member is struggling.

- If you completed your work, is there an opportunity to help the rest of the team reach the goal?
