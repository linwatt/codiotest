Regardless of the client's culture, they view us as consultants and expect us to be professional and the experts. No matter what the clients culture, good or bad, we need to maintain our professional standards.

<h3>How do I do that?</h3>
**1) Remember - You're a guest**
We are a guest of the client and should conduct ourselves accordingly. Keep personal conversations to a minimum and in private. Avoid foul language or something that could be considered offensive. Donâ€™t criticize the client or participate in gossip

**2) Dress Code**
While the dress code at the Riis office is more relaxed, each client is different. When at a client, dress at or above the clients standards.

**3) Working Hours**
Work the client's standard hours.  If the client is flexible, establish core hours. Be Punctual: arrive to work on time, work the full eight hours and keep lunch to an hour.

**4) Personal**
When the client brings us on, it is generally at a higher rate.  We need to make sure the client knows we are focused on the job. Limit personal online usage, avoid personal activities, and do not use the client resources for personal use.

**5) Billing**
Bill the client for the hours you worked. Don't bill for:
- Coming in late or leaving early
- Lunch
- PTO
- Riis holidays
- Client holidays

The client may require you to document your time in their system, in addition to OpenAir.

**6) PTO and Sick Days**
When requesting less than 5 days of PTO, then work directly with the client.   If you are requesting 5 days or more of PTO, work with your Riis sales person to help coordinate with the client.  

If you need use a sick day, let the client know.

Make sure you are communicating with your Riis manager and entering your requests into OpenAir.

If you are going to be out of the office for more than a day, let your Riis sales person know. That way, they can coordinate client visits for when you are in the office

**7) Holidays**
Communicate to the client if Riis has a holiday the client does not observe. If the client has a holiday that Riis does not observe, contact Riis human resources.  There may be an options for non billable work in the office.

**8) Client Activities**
A client may have special activities or benefits it offers to its employees such as outings, providing lunch, holiday hours etc.  As a consultant, you cannot assume you may participate or be billable.  If you are not sure, contact your Riis sales person to help you out. If you do participate, remember that you still represent Riis.
