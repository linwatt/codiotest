Most of us have gone through drivers training.  We are all taught the same rules and how to drive. To pass the written and drivers test, we apply what was learned.  

Once you've been driving for a while, you will notice that other drivers not following the rules learned. You may notice the same thing when starting a new engagement. We may notice the client has adapted their own style for how they get the job done.

If they have a better way of doing things, this is an opportunity to learn and add to your tool belt.  

If they are more laid back, then we should apply what we learned in school, training, and what we know is the right thing.
