**the client offers you a job?** 
This is great news and Riis will be supportive on your decision.  

We ask that you politely thank the client and tell the you need time to consider the offer and then talk to your manager who will follow up with sales and HR.

**you are having issues with client?**
If you are having issues or concerns with the client, you have support.  Depending on the engagement, there is an engagement manager you can work with.  If not, you can talk with your Riis manager or sales person.
Riis supports the team improving their skills and learning new ones.  If you're not sure what your options are, work with your Riis manager. 

**the engagement is ending?**
When your engagement is coming to an end, we want to ensure we leave on a good note. Ask the client what is needed before you leave. Document the transition plan and communicate your progress.

**the engagement is done?**
When your engagement is done, the client project is complete. Next steps include:
- Preform your own retro on how the engagement went. What went well, what did not go well, what can you work on for the next engagement.
- Knowledge share with the Riis team
- Update your resume with new skills and accomplishments
- Prepare for interviews

While on the bench, the expectation is that you work 40 hours.  Work with your manager on your schedule.  Riis core hours are 10am -3pm.
